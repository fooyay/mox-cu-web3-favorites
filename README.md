What does this project do?
1. Deploy our Vyper contract from raw python.
2. Encrypt our private keys locally, and use them to sign transactions.
3. This is going to be reproducible by other engineers using uv with python.

What are we going to learn?
1. What a transaction is comprised of.
2. What a JSON keystore is.
3. How to safely store a private key.

## Notes
- Uses Vyper version 0.4.3; Cyfrin's course is based on 0.4.0, so I wanted to see what changed.
